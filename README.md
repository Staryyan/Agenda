Agenda, a free meeting administration system.

At frist, it is built in c++ and have a simple UI in the terminial.
After finishing writing the simple version of Agenda, I wanna build it as a website and that is what I have done. This website is built in MVC model, Java as the business logical layer, servlet as the controller layer, and Bootstarp as presentation layer.

Thanks for reviewing my codes.

Happy coding.
